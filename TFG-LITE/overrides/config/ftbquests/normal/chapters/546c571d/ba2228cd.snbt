		"§9§aTransformers§r allow you to step up and down Voltage tiers safely. Transformers change the power they receive into an equivalent amount of power 1 voltage tier above or below the input voltage.",
		"",
		"Apart from running machines on different voltage tiers, Transformers are useful for transporting power across longer distances. Cable loss has less of an effect at higher voltages.",
		"",
		"Transformers have 5 low voltage sides, and 1 high voltage side.",
		"",
		"This quest calls for two different types of Transformers; get §eeither§o§r to complete the quest. The §9normal§r Transformer can only do 1A <-> 4A conversion, but §9Adjustable§r Transformers can be changed between 1A <-> 4A, 2A <-> 8A, 4A <-> 16A, and 16A <-> 64A conversions. ",

		"Use a §aSoft Hammer§r to change between transform up and down, and a §aScrewdriver§r on Adjustable Transformers to change the amperage.",
