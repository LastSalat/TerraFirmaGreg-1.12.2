tfg.quests.steam.era.title=&dEra 2 - Steam

tfg.quests.steam.maincheck.title=Let's start the steam era!
tfg.quests.steam.maincheck.subtitle=&aThe steam era begins, here you will finally be able to make a furnace, and an alloy furnace that will save you from the million hours you spent forging.

tfg.quests.steam.primitivewaterpump.subtitle=&aYour first pump. Put it on any water, and it will start to extract water for you.

tfg.quests.steam.primitivewatertank.subtitle=&aRemember Railcraft? Well, now the GT has some kind of the same tanks, but with more functionality.

tfg.quests.steam.safe.subtitle=&aAn interesting safe, I don't know why you might need it. Well, for example, hiding things from friends.

tfg.quests.steam.mortar.title=Mortar
tfg.quests.steam.mortar.subtitle=&aYou will need it to make it easier to crumble metals, or to create alloys right in your hands.

tfg.quests.steam.tools.title=Tools

tfg.quests.steam.wroughtironplates.title=Forged iron plates
tfg.quests.steam.wroughtironplates.subtitle=&aOpen access to improved solar and lava boilers.

tfg.quests.steam.fluidpipe.title=Fluid pipe
tfg.quests.steam.fluidpipe.disc=¬ßoTo not confound with a certain man. ¬ßrThe fluid pipes have been reworked in GTCEu, and they now work really well. The one issue they have is the limited throughput, which you may encounter as you upgrade to more and more boilers. Potin Fluid Pipes have a very ¬ß6high Throughput¬ßr, for the material tier and cost, you may use this. ¬ß9Note:¬ßr GT6-style Pipes are ¬ßdenabled¬ßr. It means that placing Pipes connect them only to the block they were placed against. To open more connection, use your ¬ß5Wrench¬ßr on the grid.

tfg.quests.steam.itempipe.title=Item Pipes
tfg.quests.steam.itempipe.desc=Item Pipes are a simple yet very effective way to move items around ¬ßdinstantly¬ßr, but with throughput limitations. Higher tier pipes provide ridiculously large throughput, a rare sight in modded Minecraft! Item Pipes ¬ß9do not pull¬ßr, but they will push any item inserted into them to other connected inventories, prioritizing ¬ß9the closest¬ßr first. The priority mechanics are ¬ßomore complicated¬ßr, so skip ahead if you are not interested. A Destination will have a Routing Value calculated, which is the sum of all Routing Values of the individual Pipes to that Destination. Whichever Destination has the lowest Routing Value will be the one selected for Insertion. ¬ß9Restrictive Pipes¬ßr typically have the lowest Priority for insertion due to their higher Routing Value. Right now, you can use them in combination with ¬ß6Hoppers¬ßr, but you will also be able to use them with Conveyor Modules, Output Buses, and machine Auto-Outputs all in the LV age. You can use your Wrench to disconnect a side of a pipe.

tfg.quests.steam.diffboilers.title=Limited edition boilers
tfg.quests.steam.diffboilers.subtitle=&aInteresting boilers that are quite situational and are not usually used. But if you have the materials for them and fuel, then this is the best solution to the steam problem for you.

tfg.quests.steam.advforgehammer.subtitle=&aImproved steam hammer, better than bronze. Of the functions: allows you to make plates from ingots at a more favorable rate.

tfg.quests.steam.bronzeforgehammer.subtitle=&aA steam hammer that will allow you to make plates from ingots at a more favorable rate.

tfg.quests.steam.miner.subtitle=&aA drilling rig, terribly slow and expensive for a couple. But at the initial stages, at least something. Put it over the vein on the surface and turn it on.

tfg.quests.steam.bronzemacerator.subtitle=&aA crusher that opens the way for you to more productive sources of production of materials from ores.

tfg.quests.steam.bronzerockbreaker.subtitle=&aA very strange mechanism. They say it was invented by the Hilichurls 400 years ago.

tfg.quests.steam.bronzeextractor.subtitle=&aYou will get the first rubber right here, and stop, there is also a path through the gutters from a primitive branch, ehh...

tfg.quests.steam.bronzecompressor.subtitle=&aAllows you to make blocks.

tfg.quests.steam.bronzealloysmelter.subtitle=&aA universal device, you definitely need to do it first, and it will make blocks for you, and plates at a super favorable rate, whatever you want.

tfg.quests.steam.bronzefurnace.subtitle=&aMELT ORES, FORGET ABOUT TFC!

tfg.quests.steam.grinder.subtitle=&aAn even cooler, multi-block crusher.

tfg.quests.steam.bronzeoven.subtitle=&aMulti-block stove, cool!

tfg.quests.steam.basiccircuit.subtitle=&aYour first processor, as powerful as some kind of pentium.

tfg.quests.steam.invar.title=Invar Ingot

tfg.quests.steam.mininghammer.subtitle=&aHammer digging 3x3.

tfg.quests.lv.200iq.desc2=To circumvent the Electrolyzer getting stuck with not enough inputs, place a ¬ßcRobot Arm with a Smart Item Filter¬ßr on your Electrolyzer. Configure it to ¬ßdImport¬ßr, ¬ßdSupply Exact¬ßr. Now, attach any inventory (a chest will do) on the side where you placed the Robot Arm, and TADAA! You have made automatic smart insertion to handle all Electrolyzer recipes!
tfg.quests.lv.200iq.desc3=¬ß9Note:¬ßr The Robot Arm has to do Item transfer itself for its functionality to work! Inserting directly into the machine will ignore the Robot Arm's ¬ßdSupply Exact¬ßr. 
tfg.quests.lv.200iq.desc4=Now, as for the output of the Electrolyzer, you may want to route the Fluids to several Tanks, or even ¬ß3Super Tanks¬ßr. I highly recommend ¬ßcto not void¬ßr the Fluids, except for Water for obvious reasons."

If you are filling like helping us with filling up guides, please go ahead and message us on our ¬ß8Discord¬ßr (link is in the Curseforge page) with the work you've put.
tfg.quests.lv.terminal.desc4=¬ß9System Settings¬ßr changes... settings (duh) related to the Terminal. You can ¬ßbset your own background picture¬ßr, remove the double confirmation on exit, and more. Most of the keybinds apply to the ¬ß5Home¬ßr button. Double clicking by default exists the Application.
tfg.quests.lv.terminal.desc5=¬ß9Multiblock Helper¬ßr is split into two functionalities.  The first one requires a requires a ¬ßdLV¬ßr Battery and a ¬ßdCamera¬ßr mounted to enable ¬ßbVR visualization¬ßr of multiblock structures.  The upgrade unlocked at ¬ß6HV¬ßr allows you to ¬ß6debug¬ßr and ¬ß6auto-build¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.terminal.desc6=¬ß9Battery Manager¬ßr, assuming you have a Battery mounted, checks the Energy level and indicates energy usage of other Apps.
tfg.quests.lv.terminal.desc7=¬ß9Hardware Manager¬ßr is used to mount Hardwares, such as Battery, to enable other Apps.
tfg.quests.lv.terminal.desc8=¬ß9App Store¬ßr (not exactly a Store) adds Apps to your collection, and allows upgrades for some of them. Keep in mind Apps may still require specific mounted devices to function.
tfg.quests.lv.terminal.desc9=¬ß9Pong¬ßr, ¬ß9Theseus' Escape¬ßr, ¬ß9Minesweeper¬ßr are minigame Apps. Don't forget to play GregTech, too!
tfg.quests.lv.terminal.desc10=¬ß9Ore Prospector¬ßr works the same way as the portable ¬ßdProspector¬ßr and can be upgraded several times.
tfg.quests.lv.terminal.desc11=¬ß9Recipe Chart¬ßr is a wonderful chart planner to build Recipe Chains and visualize them.
tfg.quests.lv.terminal.desc12=¬ß9GT Console¬ßr configures machines as if you were using regular tools, but without using them! This is similar to the remote access from the ¬ß3Central Monitor¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.terminal.desc13=¬ß9World Prospector¬ßr is a ¬ßdX-Ray VR¬ßr for filtered blocks.
tfg.quests.lv.terminal.desc14=¬ß9Virtual Tank Viewer¬ßr is used in combination with ¬ß3Ender Fluid Covers¬ßr. It stores information about all your ¬ßdVirtual Tanks¬ßr.

tfg.quests.lv.drillin.title=We Drillin'
tfg.quests.lv.drillin.subtitle=¬ßoThe mining drill is a nice Mining Tool, it comes in different tiers. The LV Drill may not be too appealing, but later drills can mine 3x3x3, 5x5x5, and up to 9x9x9 to make huge holes!¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.drillin.desc1=This suggested drill is with a Diamond tip, which might be the best material for it right now.
tfg.quests.lv.drillin.desc2=¬ß9Note:¬ßr All Electric Tools have a lot more durability than indicated, as they use Energy to prevent damage from being applied! On top of that, they can be enchanted as Pickaxes can.
tfg.quests.lv.drillin.desc3=¬ß9Other note:¬ßr Batteries in your inventory can be shift right-clicked to ¬ßdenable charging¬ßr your EU items. Don't do it ¬ßowhile¬ßr mining though, as your item will be constantly updated and it will keep resetting the mining progress. 
tfg.quests.lv.drillin.desc4=You may make hold off and make a MV drill ¬ßeinstead¬ßr. That one will be completely worth it.

tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.title=Electricity Generation and Transportation
tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.subtitle=&aTURBINE! Yes, and also a steam engine, your first electric car. Your new adventure begins with her!
tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.desc1=¬ßoYes, you will need more Steam production!  The Steam pressure will exert a force on the Turbines. Their rotation activate the Generator, producing Electricity.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.desc2=The ¬ß3Steam Turbine¬ßr is the only Generator you can realistically use in the LV Age. ¬ß2Later you will unlock more Power options¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.desc3=¬ßd2 Steam=1 EU¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.desc4=¬ßlIntroduction to ¬ß9¬ßlElectric Energy Transportation¬ßr¬ßl:¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.desc5=¬ß1EU¬ßr - the Energy Unit - is transported through direct connection, ¬ßaWires¬ßr or ¬ßaCables¬ßr. Wires are inferior, as they will ¬ßcelectrocute¬ßr you and ¬ßclose more energy¬ßr, so you want to use Cables.
tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.desc6=¬ßcCable loss¬ßr means you will have to stick your Machines close to your Generators, but that kind of issue is only for the early game. If you look up ahead, you will be able to obtain ¬ß6Superconductors¬ßr down the line.
tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.desc7=If you use one single ¬ß3Steam Turbine¬ßr, you may use ¬ßa1x Tin Cables¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.desc8=If you upgrade to ¬ß32 Steam Turbines¬ßr, you should use ¬ßa2x Tin Cables¬ßr, else they may end up ¬ßcburning¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.desc9=This is because of the ¬ß9Amperage¬ßr mechanic... but that will be explained later so you can enjoy playing.
tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.desc10=¬ß9Note:¬ßr GT6-style Cables are ¬ßdenabled¬ßr. It means that placing Cables connect them only to the block they were placed against. To open more connections, use your ¬ß5Wire Cutter¬ßr on the grid.
tfg.quests.lv.steamturbine.desc11=¬ß2GTCEu¬ßr Cables now have ¬ß6native RF support¬ßr! You can plug any RF appliance into an EU source and it will automatically convert. The ratio is ¬ßa4 : 1¬ßr (RF : EU).

tfg.quests.lv.covers.title=Covers Behavior
tfg.quests.lv.covers.subtitle=¬ßoCovers are ways to give your machines extra behavior without using any extra block space.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.covers.desc1=Covers are placed by right-clicking with it on a face of a machine, and removed with a Crowbar (or by mining the machine, but that's too brutal!).
tfg.quests.lv.covers.desc2=Pretty much any GregTech TileEntity will accept Covers, even if they provide no functionality.
tfg.quests.lv.covers.desc3=For the Covers transferring Items/Fluids, you will have a button to enable/disable other forms of transfer through the cover:
tfg.quests.lv.covers.desc4=¬ß9- ¬ßrDisabled: only the cover will be allowed to transfer on this machine side.
tfg.quests.lv.covers.desc5=¬ß9-¬ßr Allow Filtered (only relevant with a filter!): other transfer will be enabled only if it matches the filter
tfg.quests.lv.covers.desc6=¬ß9-¬ßr Allow Unfiltered: any other transfer is allowed on this machine side.
tfg.quests.lv.covers.desc7=Placing a cover of a lower voltage tier on a machine is ¬ßasafe¬ßr.

tfg.quests.lv.motora.title=LV Electric Motora
tfg.quests.lv.motora.subtitle=¬ßoOne of the gatekeepers to the LV Age... You are getting close.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.motora.desc1=We are cutting down the retrieval task counts as you progress further into the modpack so you don't have to check several times which items to submit. Remember that JEI is your friend if you forgot how to craft things!
tfg.quests.lv.motora.desc2=Craft six ¬ßaLV Electric Motors¬ßr! This may seem like a lot, but that's the bare minimum required to get to the good stuff in LV Age.
tfg.quests.lv.motora.des—Å3=¬ß6Once you complete this Quest and the Electronic Circuit Quest, you are ready to move on to the LV Age.¬ßr

tfg.quests.lv.pump.title=LV Electric Pump
tfg.quests.lv.pump.subtitle=¬ßoA crafting component, but also a cover!¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.pump.desc1=The pump, when placed on a machine, will transfer fluid. You can configure it to import or export.
tfg.quests.lv.pump.desc2=It can accept a ¬ß9Fluid Filter¬ßr.

tfg.quests.lv.conveyor.title=LV Conveyor Module
tfg.quests.lv.conveyor.subtitle=A crafting component, but also a cover!¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.conveyor.desc1=The Conveyor Module, when placed on a machine, will transfer items. You can configure it to import or export.
tfg.quests.lv.conveyor.desc2=This has a special interaction with Item Pipes to enable perfect ¬ßdRound Robin¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.conveyor.desc3=It can also accept various ¬ß9Item Filters¬ßr.

tfg.quests.lv.regulator.title=Fluid Regulator
tfg.quests.lv.regulator.subtitle=A cover!¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.regulator.desc1=The ¬ßaFluid Regulator¬ßr is sort of the equivalent to a ¬ß9Robot Arm¬ßr for Fluids.
tfg.quests.lv.regulator.desc2=It can transfer fluids, but has two useful modes:
tfg.quests.lv.regulator.desc3=¬ß9-¬ßr ¬ßdSupply Exact¬ßr will transfer the amount of specified Fluid per tick if available. No more, no less.
tfg.quests.lv.regulator.desc4=¬ß9-¬ßr ¬ßdKeep Exact¬ßr will make sure the exact amount of Fluid in the attached machine is being kept.

tfg.quests.lv.piston.title=LV Electric Piston
tfg.quests.lv.piston.subtitle=A crafting component, did you expect anything fancier?¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.piston.desc=Just like the LV Motor, it is used to craft LV machines.

tfg.quests.lv.robot.title=LV Robot Arm
tfg.quests.lv.robot.subtitle=A crafting component, OH MY GOSH THIS ONE IS EXPENSIVE, but also a cover!¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.robot.desc1=The Robot Arm, when placed on a machine, is a more advanced Conveyor Module. It lets you transfer items in specific batches, at specific rates, or keep a certain amount of items stocked.
tfg.quests.lv.robot.desc2=Actual uses for the Robot Arm will be explained in future Quests as tutorial.
tfg.quests.lv.robot.desc3=¬ß9Note:¬ßr The functionalities provided by the Robot Arm work ¬ßlonly¬ßr if it is doing the operation..

tfg.quests.lv.amps.title=But what are Amps?
tfg.quests.lv.amps.subtitle=¬ßoThe concepts presented are for the curious players. Don't read past the TL;DR if you are not interested.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.amps.desc1=TL;DR:¬ßr For safety, match the Amperage limit of your Cables with the max amount of Amps from Energy Producers.
tfg.quests.lv.amps.desc2=You surely have realised by now the Energy system in ¬ß2GregTech¬ßr is ¬ßcnot as simple¬ßr as the ¬ß1RF¬ßr you may be used to using in modded Minecraft!
tfg.quests.lv.amps.desc3=¬ß1EU¬ßr mechanics have a depth to them and are not dissimilar to real electricity. It can also be ¬ß4dangerous¬ßr if mishandled. But it also gives a lot of ¬ß6satisfaction¬ßr, if harnessed well.
tfg.quests.lv.amps.desc4=This Quest tackles the ¬ß9Amperage¬ßr mechanics. As for the ¬ßdVoltage¬ßr mechanics, that will be explained once you reach ¬ßbMV¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.amps.desc5=Each single-block Generator in GregTech is configured to produce ¬ß91 Amp¬ßr for its voltage tier. For ¬ß7LV¬ßr, that results in ¬ß232EU/t¬ßr. If a machine requires 16EU/t, one packet of 32EU is sent every other tick (assuming no cable loss).
tfg.quests.lv.amps.desc6=A Battery Buffer with ¬ß94¬ßr Batteries can produce up to ¬ß94 Amps¬ßr, for ¬ß2128EU/t¬ßr as ¬ß7LV¬ßr, which is important for the ¬ß3Electric Blast Furnace¬ßr, or to run multiple machines simultaneously. Generic machines are configured to draw up to ¬ß92 Amps¬ßr to account for cable loss. Other machines have specific ¬ß9Amps IN¬ßr, described in the tooltip.
tfg.quests.lv.amps.desc7=Cables¬ßr have an ¬ß9Amperage ¬ßclimit¬ßr. Attempting to transport more Amps than the limit will ¬ß4burn¬ßr them.
tfg.quests.lv.amps.desc8=Amps¬ßr are drawn ¬ßoonly¬ßr through the ¬ßaCables¬ßr connecting the Producers and Consumers directly, and ¬ßoonly¬ßr if the Consumers are active.  This means you can safely step down your Cables in certain places, feel free to experiment!

tfg.quests.lv.amperage.title=The Amperage and Voltage Concept
tfg.quests.lv.amperage.subtitle=¬ßoYou can put this quest off and come back to it once you hit MV Age. ¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.amperage.desc1=This quest will go into the energy mechanics in more detail. If you have a basic understanding of electricity in ¬ßereal life¬ßr, the GTEU system is not too different! An even more in-depth guide can be found on the GTCEu wiki.
tfg.quests.lv.amperage.desc2=Electrical energy in ¬ßdGregTech¬ßr is measured in ¬ßdEnergy Units (EU)¬ßr. They are transported down connections in ¬ße¬ßdpackets (p)¬ßr. Packet transfer has two parameters: ¬ß2Voltage¬ßr is the amount of EU in each packet ¬ß2(EU/p, or V)¬ßr, and ¬ß2Amperage¬ßr is the number of packets which pass a point per tick ¬ß2(p/t, or A)¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.amperage.desc3=Think of Cables in a network as a ¬ßehighway¬ßr, with packets being the cars on it: ¬ß2voltage¬ßr is analogous to the ¬ßaspeed¬ßr of each car, and ¬ß2amperage¬ßr is like the ¬ßanumber of cars¬ßr which pass through the highway per unit of time. (This applies to real life too!)
tfg.quests.lv.amperage.desc4=¬ß2¬ßrThe product of ¬ß2Voltage¬ßr and ¬ß2Amperage (V x A, or EU/p x p/t)¬ßr is ¬ßdpower¬ßr, or ¬ßdEU/t¬ßr. This is what machines list their energy consumption as. For example, the ¬ß3EBF ¬ßbAluminium¬ßr recipe calls for ¬ßd120 EU/t¬ßr, and this can be supplied as ¬ßd30V x 4A¬ßr (supplied as 4A of ¬ß7LV¬ßr), or ¬ßd120V x 1A¬ßr (supplied as 1A of ¬ßbMV¬ßr). 
tfg.quests.lv.amperage.desc5=Here comes the ¬ß4dangerous¬ßr part: 
tfg.quests.lv.amperage.desc6=- Cables and Wires which receive higher ¬ß2voltage¬ßr than their rating will ¬ßcburn¬ßr! Cables and Wires will also ¬ßcburn¬ßr if too many ¬ß2amps¬ßr pass through them.
tfg.quests.lv.amperage.desc7=- Machines which receive higher ¬ß2voltage¬ßr than their tier will ¬ßcexplode¬ßr! Putting extra ¬ß3¬ß2amps¬ßr into a machine is ¬ßasafe¬ßr, however.
tfg.quests.lv.amperage.desc8=¬ß9¬ßlTL;DR:¬ßr Group up Machines and Generators by ¬ß2Voltage¬ßr, and avoid sharing them.
tfg.quests.lv.amperage.desc9=¬ß9Note:¬ßr The Amperage bug, exploit, feature (call it whatever you want!) from GTCE has been ¬ßlfixed¬ßr in GTCEu. Now the Energy net works as intended.

tfg.quests.lv.diode.title=Diode
tfg.quests.lv.diode.subtitle=¬ßoThis quest's subject is optional and less useful. We have put it here in the name of completeness, but if this is not useful to you, feel free to skip it.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.diode.desc1=The ¬ßaDiode¬ßr (block, not item component) accepts energy inputs from 5 sides, but only outputs through a single side. Its main use is to act as a repeater to boost energy levels back to full across lossy cables, but it could also be useful in some compact setups.
tfg.quests.lv.diode.desc2=You can use a ¬ß9Soft Hammer¬ßr to change the Amperage limit of the output.

tfg.quests.lv.transformers.title=Transformers
tfg.quests.lv.transformers.subtitle=¬ß9¬ßaTransformers¬ßr allow you to step up and down Voltage tiers safely. Transformers change the power they receive into an equivalent amount of power 1 voltage tier above or below the input voltage.
tfg.quests.lv.transformers.desc1=Apart from running machines on different voltage tiers, Transformers are useful for transporting power across longer distances. Cable loss has less of an effect at higher voltages.
tfg.quests.lv.transformers.desc2=Transformers have 5 low voltage sides, and 1 high voltage side.
tfg.quests.lv.transformers.desc3=This quest calls for two different types of Transformers; get ¬ßeeither¬ßo¬ßr to complete the quest. The ¬ß9normal¬ßr Transformer can only do 1A <-> 4A conversion, but ¬ß9Adjustable¬ßr Transformers can be changed between 1A <-> 4A, 2A <-> 8A, 4A <-> 16A, and 16A <-> 64A conversions. 
tfg.quests.lv.transformers.desc4=Use a ¬ßaSoft Hammer¬ßr to change between transform up and down, and a ¬ßaScrewdriver¬ßr on Adjustable Transformers to change the amperage.
tfg.quests.lv.transformers.desc5=Higher tier Transformers require ¬ß9Coils¬ßr.

tfg.quests.lv.lboiler.title=Large Bronze Boiler
tfg.quests.lv.lboiler.subtitle=&a¬ßoThis Quest in an overview for the Large Bronze Boiler.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.lboiler.desc1=I do ¬ßlNOT¬ßr¬ß9 recommend¬ßr getting this until you are done with most - if not all - of the LV Age. It is also ¬ß6optional¬ßr, depending on which power options you chose.
tfg.quests.lv.lboiler.desc2=The ¬ß3Large Boilers¬ßr ultimately are ¬ßothe¬ßr option for large scale Steam production. They will run off solid and liquid fuels.
tfg.quests.lv.lboiler.desc3=Important:¬ßr This Boiler can also ¬ßcexplode¬ßr similarly to the regular Boilers! I would like to say the explosion is not kind... but it's configured to not damage blocks or entities.
tfg.quests.lv.lboiler.desc4=¬ßcWater supply is crucial¬ßr. But simply upgrading the ¬ß3Output Hatch¬ßr on your ¬ß3Primitive Pump¬ßr should be enough.
tfg.quests.lv.lboiler.desc5=Once fully heated up, the ¬ß3LBB¬ßr produces 800 Steam per tick, which is ¬ßd400EU/t¬ßr after conversion, or 12.5 Basic Steam Turbines! This (relatively!) immense power comes at the cost of ¬ßla lot¬ßr of burnable fuel.
tfg.quests.lv.lboiler.desc6=¬ß5¬ßlBut¬ßr the GUI can let you ¬ß9throttle¬ßr the Boiler, down to 25% power for 200 Steam per tick. That is ¬ßd100EU/t¬ßr, or slightly above 3 Basic Steam Turbines.
tfg.quests.lv.lboiler.desc7=Note:¬ßr More information about Multiblocks are given after you get the Electric Blast Furnace at the end of the LV Age. That's one way to prevent you from getting this too early!

tfg.quests.lv.multiblocktanks.title=Multiblock Tanks
tfg.quests.lv.multiblocktanks.subtitle=Multiblock Tanks can store a larger amount of fluid, but aren't portable like Drums are. The ¬ß6Steel Multiblock Tank¬ßr holds ¬ßa1,000,000 mB¬ßr of fluid.
tfg.quests.lv.multiblocktanks.desc1=A ¬ß6Wooden¬ßr¬ßr version exists which holds ¬ßa250,000 mB¬ßr, but it cannot store ¬ßchot fluids¬ßr such as Lava, or ¬ßcgases¬ßr such as Oxygen.
tfg.quests.lv.multiblocktanks.desc2=Fluid transfer is done through the Controller block, or up to two additional Valve blocks.
tfg.quests.lv.multiblocktanks.desc3=Valves can ¬ßdauto-output¬ßr by making them ¬ßdface down¬ßr. Using Pumps Covers is also an option.
tfg.quests.lv.multiblocktanks.desc4=These optional yet fancy Tanks are alternatives to fluid storage until you unlock the greater ¬ß9Super Tanks¬ßr.

tfg.quests.lv.batterybuffer.title=Battery Buffer
tfg.quests.lv.batterybuffer.subtitle=¬ßoBy itself, the Battery Buffer does nothing. What it does, however, is accept batteries in its inventory, to act as a... buffer... with the... batteries. I hope you got it!¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.batterybuffer.desc1=The ¬ß3Battery Buffer¬ßr handles ¬ß9two Amps in¬ßr, and ¬ß9one Amp out¬ßr ¬ßdper Battery¬ßr. Output side has the dot, all other sides are inputs.
tfg.quests.lv.batterybuffer.desc2=It will also charge both EU and RF Tools inside it¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.batterybuffer.desc3=This is a must have if you don't have unlimited power at hand.
tfg.quests.lv.batterybuffer.desc4=Get ¬ßeeither¬ßr a four slot, or an eight slot Battery Buffer. A sixteen slot variant also exists but that's overkill right now.
tfg.quests.lv.batterybuffer.desc5=Note:¬ßr Do not loop your lossy Cables back to your Battery Buffer, you will end up voiding energy!

tfg.quests.lv.hatch.title=Powering Multiblocks
tfg.quests.lv.hatch.subtitle=To power Multiblocks with energy, you need Energy Hatches.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.hatch.desc1=Multiblocks do not look at Voltage of recipes, instead they simply check if they have the Power requirement.
tfg.quests.lv.hatch.desc2=The EBF needs at least ¬ß4120EU/t¬ßr power input to run its recipes. It is achieved with ¬ß3two LV Energy Hatches¬ßr. Each one takes 2 Amps of LV, so that's 4 Amps of LV for 128EU/t maximum power.
tfg.quests.lv.hatch.desc3=Note:¬ßr Be wary of Cable ¬ßclosses¬ßr bringing the actual power input below the recipe requirement! I ¬ßlhighly¬ßr recommend placing your ¬ß3Battery Buffer¬ßr next to the ¬ß3Energy Hatches¬ßr for the minimum cable length.

tfg.quests.lv.superconductor.title=LV Superconductor
tfg.quests.lv.superconductor.subtitle=¬ßoCheck the recipe from the wire, and then in the Material JEI page, check the recipe for the dust. Handy isn't it?¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.superconductor.desc1=Superconductors¬ßr are special Wires available for each Voltage tier. They do not have any Cable counterpart, but they have absolutely ¬ß6no cable loss¬ßr! They also don't damage you when you touch them.
tfg.quests.lv.superconductor.desc2=The 1x variant also covers 2 Amps! Isn't that nice?
tfg.quests.lv.superconductor.desc3=Now is a good time to replace your crappy ¬ßaTin Cables¬ßr. Recycle them in the ¬ß3Packager¬ßr to recover both Tin and Rubber.

tfg.quests.lv.muffler.title=This is not as Scary as it looks #2.
tfg.quests.lv.muffler.subtitle=The ¬ß3Electric Blast Furnace¬ßr requires a ¬ß3Muffler Hatch¬ßr to run. This hatch must be ¬ßcunobstructed¬ßr so it can output its beautiful smoke particles.
tfg.quests.lv.muffler.desc1=When a recipe is performed, there is a small chance for the ¬ß3Muffler Hatch¬ßr to give bonus items, typically tiny Dusts of Ash.
tfg.quests.lv.muffler.desc2=Note:¬ßr Do not try to automate the extraction of items from the ¬ß3Muffler Hatch¬ßr, it is not intended. It voids excess when full, so do not worry about it stopping machines from running.

tfg.quests.lv.maintenance.title=This is not as Scary as it looks #1.
tfg.quests.lv.maintenance.subtitle=I know what you're thinking! Don't think! I mean... Maintenance in GregTech is not as bad as you think, and looking at multiblocks with this hatch makes me feel happy.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.maintenance.desc1=Most Multiblocks require a ¬ß3Maintenance Hatch¬ßr. You will need to do Maintenance for the Multiblock to begin operating.
tfg.quests.lv.maintenance.desc2=This is done by having a ¬ß9Wrench¬ßr, a ¬ß9Screwdriver¬ßr, a ¬ß9Soft Mallet¬ßr, a ¬ß9Hammer¬ßr, a ¬ß9Wire Cutter¬ßr, and a ¬ß9Crowbar¬ßr in your inventory, opening the Maintenance Hatch and ¬ßeclicking the center spot once¬ßr. ¬ßcNo need to move tools individually¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.maintenance.desc3=Alternatively you can fix problems by placing a ¬ß9Tape¬ßr in the Maintenance Hatch, but I would love to tell you that's unethical.
tfg.quests.lv.maintenance.desc4=Maintenance problems may occur after ¬ßd48 real hours of activity¬ßr. Needless to say they are very rare. Each problem increases the recipe durations by 10%. Fixing the problems is done the same way as above.
tfg.quests.lv.maintenance.desc5=At ¬ß6HV¬ßr age, you will unlock other Maintenance Hatches that do not enforce fixing the problems manually.

tfg.quests.lv.bus.title=Multiblock Input/Output
tfg.quests.lv.bus.subtitle=Similarly to the Steam Multiblocks (I hope you made them!), you will need ¬ß3Busses¬ßr to move items in and out.
tfg.quests.lv.bus.desc1=For fluids, you will need ¬ß3Hatches¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.bus.desc2=That is it, folks!

tfg.quests.lv.forming.title=Forming Multiblocks
tfg.quests.lv.forming.subtitle=¬ßoThis is a Guide to help you form Multiblocks and troubleshoot issues.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.forming.desc1=There are two really important factors to know when building Multiblocks.
tfg.quests.lv.forming.desc2=¬ßlCheck the JEI preview:¬ßr This one was probably obvious, but there's more than just a picture of how the Multiblock looks like! Use your mouse to ¬ßdrotate¬ßr the preview, ¬ß9hover over the parts¬ßr to gain additional informations. The JEI page also contains the amount of blocks to build it. You can also ¬ßdright-click¬ßr a block in the preview to get a display of all available blocks in that placement.
tfg.quests.lv.forming.desc3=¬ßlThe JEI preview is a suggestion:¬ßr There is no unique way to form the Multiblock. Most of the time, you have complete freedom for the ¬ß9tier of Buses/Hatches¬ßr. And you also have the ¬ßdfreedom of placement¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.forming.desc4=Taking the EBF as example, any tier of Energy/Bus/Hatch can be used, and they can be placed anywhere replacing a casing. Fluid Hatches are also optional, though you probably want them to handle recipes with fluid.
tfg.quests.lv.forming.desc5=Additionally, you can ¬ßdsneak right-click¬ßr the multiblock controller for an in-world preview, or use the ¬ß4Terminal¬ßr's Multiblock Helper.

tfg.quests.lv.troubleshooting.title=Multiblock Troubleshooting
tfg.quests.lv.troubleshooting.subtitle=If a multiblock is formed, but you are having troubles figuring out why it does not run:
tfg.quests.lv.troubleshooting.desc1=¬ß9-¬ßr Check if the Multiblock is properly plugged in (we all make these mistakes!).
tfg.quests.lv.troubleshooting.desc2=¬ß9-¬ßr Do the initial Maintenance fix.
tfg.quests.lv.troubleshooting.desc3=¬ß9-¬ßr Verify the recipe usage, the max EU/t has to be greater than that of the recipe.
tfg.quests.lv.troubleshooting.desc4=¬ß9-¬ßr Check the special requirements the recipe may have (JEI always has some kind of indication for it).
tfg.quests.lv.troubleshooting.desc5=¬ß9-¬ßr Make sure the recipe is properly input, this is less obvious than in a regular machine because you have to juggle between Input Bus and Input Hatch.
tfg.quests.lv.troubleshooting.desc6=¬ß9-¬ßr Make sure there is space for output. Maybe the multiblock formed but you forgot a Hatch. The other biggest offender is the Output Hatches being too low tier and having too little capacity!

tfg.quests.lv.blast.title=Electric Blast Furnace
tfg.quests.lv.blast.subtitle=Electric Blast Furnace
tfg.quests.lv.blast.desc1=The ¬ß3Electric Blast Furnace (EBF)¬ßr is your first electric multiblock! It is used to process materials at high temperatures.
tfg.quests.lv.blast.desc2=You will use the EBF to make ¬ßaAluminium¬ßr and progress to ¬ßd¬ßbMV Age¬ßr. It can also make ¬ß7Steel¬ßr faster than a PBF.
tfg.quests.lv.blast.desc3=The EBF is a beefy boy. The minimum power cost to run a recipe is ¬ß9120 EU/t¬ßr! That's slightly under 4 ¬ß7LV¬ßr Generators. This is why it was locked behind the Battery Quest. You may wish to consider building a separate power line, with separate Generators and Battery Buffer to run this.

tfg.quests.lv.aluminiumingot.title=Aluminium
tfg.quests.lv.aluminiumingot.subtitle=Aluminium¬ßr is the main ingredient for ¬ßbMV¬ßr machine hulls. Check aaaall the way to the other side for ¬ß2Sapphire Quest¬ßr if you haven't acquired ¬ßaAluminium Dust¬ßr yet.
tfg.quests.lv.aluminiumingot.desc1=Once you setup an ¬ß3MV Electrolyzer¬ßr, you can get ¬ßaAluminium¬ßr through many other ores. All of this quest's rewards bear ¬ßaAluminium¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.aluminiumingot.desc2=The process of smelting Aluminium can be accelerated with ¬ß9Nitrogen¬ßr, which is obtained by centrifuging ¬ß9Air¬ßr from a ¬ß3Gas Collector¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.aluminiumingot.desc3=You will still need MV Circuits in order to make MV machines.¬ßr

tfg.quests.lv.cupronickelcoils.title=Cupronickel Coils
tfg.quests.lv.cupronickelcoils.subtitle=Prepare ¬ßa128 Cupronickel¬ßr, ¬ßa32 Bronze¬ßr and ¬ßa16 Tin Alloy¬ßr to craft the Heating Coils for your Electric Blast Furnace.
tfg.quests.lv.cupronickelcoils.desc1=This is still less than half of the cost of the entire EBF in raw materials. You will also need about a stack each of Invar and Steel.
tfg.quests.lv.cupronickelcoils.desc2=The Cupronickel Coils will allow the EBF to perform recipes up to ¬ßd1,800K¬ßr (ignoring Voltage bonuses). That's pretty hot if you ask me.

tfg.quests.lv.magnet.title=Magnet
tfg.quests.lv.magnet.subtitle=Why can't these items I mine behave and enter my inventory!? This magnet should solve it, even if it makes no sense!¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.magnet.desc1=Charge the Magnet while you would with a ¬ß9Battery¬ßr, and ¬ßdsneak right-click¬ßr when in hand to activate it. Do it again to deactivate. It will work from anywhere in your inventory.
tfg.quests.lv.magnet.desc2=¬ß9Note:¬ßr If are you worried about getting overwhelmed by Cobblestone or Netherrack, open the trash can from FTB:Utilities in the top left corner to void them.

tfg.quests.lv.wiremill.title=Basic Wiremill
tfg.quests.lv.wiremill.subtitle=¬ßoTechnically, you could make more or less any LV Machine, but I specifically want you to make the best one of them all first! I know, I know... You're asking where is your freedom of choice.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.wiremill.desc1=No more painful wires! This machine lets you make ¬ß6two Wires from one Ingot¬ßr, that should be three times cheaper than what you were doing up until now!
tfg.quests.lv.wiremill.desc2=To the right of this Quest are more important machines which will help you a lot to get cheaper intermediates.
tfg.quests.lv.wiremill.desc3=¬ß9Note:¬ßr Recipes inside ¬ß3LV Machines¬ßr go up to ¬ßaUsage: 32 EU/t (LV)¬ßr. Anything higher than that and you will need a MV or even better machine instead. Needless to say that's for later.

tfg.quests.lv.bending.title=Basic Bending Machine
tfg.quests.lv.bending.subtitle=¬ßoArgueably the second best LV machine to craft, but the choice is yours!¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.bending.desc1=This helps converting one ¬ß6Ingot into one Plate¬ßr, which is a better ratio than the Forge Hammer.
tfg.quests.lv.bending.desc2=You will need a ¬ßdProgrammed Circuit¬ßr for recipes. That would be nice if the questbook designer gave one for free, wouldn't it?
tfg.quests.lv.bending.desc3=You can right click the Programmed Circuit in your hand or within the machine's ¬ßaConfiguration Slot¬ßr to change the configuration number. Note that at the time of writing, this slot is ¬ßcnot detected¬ßr for recipes!

tfg.quests.lv.polarizer.title=Basic Polarizer
tfg.quests.lv.polarizer.subtitle=¬ßoThe Polarizer polarizes... We're doing this again aren't we?¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.polarizer.desc=One of the cheapest - if not the cheapest - LV machine. Use this to make ¬ß6Redstone-free Magnetic Rods¬ßr for your Motors.

tfg.quests.lv.lathe.title=Basic Lathe
tfg.quests.lv.lathe.subtitle=¬ßoThe Lathe lathes... We should probably rename these machines to avoid these terrible quest introductions!¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.lathe.desc=An important machine to help shape metals. Thanks to it, you can turn ¬ß6one Ingot into two Rods¬ßr, and ¬ß6one Bolt into one screw¬ßr. That's twice the efficiency on those recipes as opposed to crafting.

tfg.quests.lv.canning.title=Basic Canning Machine
tfg.quests.lv.canning.subtitle=This machine does nothing exciting. It puts stuff into stuff.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.canning.desc=Make this machine only when you feel like it's time you invest into Batteries.


tfg.quests.lv.batteryingot.title=Battery Preparations!
tfg.quests.lv.batteryingot.subtitle=Batteries are great! They let you store energy if you have too little or too much power generation.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.batteryingot.desc=Make some Battery Alloy, used for Battery Hulls.

tfg.quests.lv.chemicalreactor.title=Basic Chemical Reactor
tfg.quests.lv.chemicalreactor.subtitle=This of a chemical reaction, either realistic, theorical or invented by the power of video gaming. The Chemical Reactor will create the conditions for it to happen, and TADAAA. You can also call this a magic box, if you want.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.chemicalreactor.desc1=The ¬ß3Chemical Reactor¬ßr will be required for ¬ßla lot¬ßr of recipes.
tfg.quests.lv.chemicalreactor.desc2=Then, use your freshly made Chemical Reactor to unlock a new, ¬ß6better recipe for Rubber¬ßr. It is ¬ßdunusable¬ßr as a Fluid, so you will need to make another machine next.
tfg.quests.lv.chemicalreactor.desc3=Make an ¬ß3Solidifier¬ßr to solidify directly into ¬ßaRubber Sheets¬ßr. You want this.
tfg.quests.lv.chemicalreactor.desc4=Make an ¬ß3Assembling Machine¬ßr to use the molten Rubber for ¬ßaCables¬ßr. Not important for Tin Cables.
tfg.quests.lv.chemicalreactor.desc5=¬ßeNote:¬ßr Submit a fluid by having it stored in ¬ßlany¬ßr tank in your inventory. A Drum is the perfect candidate.

tfg.quests.lv.cells.title=Dead Cells
tfg.quests.lv.cells.subtitle=GTCE killed Cell Chemistry... GTCE killed Cells!
tfg.quests.lv.cells.desc1=... So let's have GTCEu revive them! Nonono, not the Cell Chemistry, the ¬ß9¬ßoCells¬ßr.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.cells.desc2=Cells are an alternative form of Fluid storage. All Cell types with the same type and amount of Fluid inside them ¬ß6stack¬ßr. They can be automatically filled with a ¬ß3Canning Machine¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.cells.desc3=Cells hold ¬ßdone bucket¬ßr of Fluid.
tfg.quests.lv.cells.desc4=Universal Cells hold up to ¬ßdone bucket¬ßr, but also can store ¬ß9fractions¬ßr of Buckets. Ideal to store leftover Fluid without spending a whole Drum. 
tfg.quests.lv.cells.desc5=Cells made from higher tier materials can hold even more fluid, but ¬ß9Drums¬ßr and ¬ß9Super Tanks¬ßr will hold more by then.
tfg.quests.lv.cells.desc6=Like Drums, Cells can be placed into a crafting grid to clear their contents.

tfg.quests.lv.solidifier.title=Basic Fluid Solidifier
tfg.quests.lv.solidifier.subtitle=¬ßoThe Fluid Solidifier Solidifies... Or you could say it freezes stuff if you like cursedness.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.solidifier.desc1=Build this machine next to your ¬ß3Chemical Reactor¬ßr to automatically solidify Rubber into ¬ßaRubber Sheets¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.solidifier.desc2=Then, ¬ßdwrench¬ßr the side of your ¬ß3Chemical Reactor¬ßr and enable Fluid ¬ß9auto-output¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.solidifier.desc3=There will be more Fluids to solidify, so you may re-purpose your ¬ß3Fluid Solidifier¬ßr when not crafting Rubber.


tfg.quests.lv.rotor.title=Combo!
tfg.quests.lv.rotor.subtitle=Time to end the misery of hand crafting rotors!¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.rotor.desc1=Use both your machines to turn a material into a Fluid, and solidify it back to a Rotor! This combination makes up for ¬ß6four Ingots per Rotor¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.rotor.desc2=You can also do the same for ¬ß6Gears¬ßr and ¬ß6Small Gears¬ßr, which will then be superseded by the ¬ß3MV Extruder¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.rotor.desc3=Note:¬ßr Some metals require higher voltage than LV for Fluid Extraction, so keep that in mind.

tfg.quests.lv.prospector.title=This is Hacking
tfg.quests.lv.prospector.subtitle=The Prospector is an amazing tool to find veins.
tfg.quests.lv.prospector.desc=Its GUI is interactive, and... I do not have much more to say. ¬ß6It is great¬ßr.

tfg.quests.lv.batteries.title=Batteries!
tfg.quests.lv.batteries.subtitle=¬ßaBatteries¬ßr for storing energy! They can be put into the energy slot at the bottom middle of machine GUIs, or in a ¬ß9Battery Buffer¬ßr. Each battery accepts up to ¬ßatwo amps¬ßr, and outputs up to ¬ßaone amp¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.batteries.desc1=Batteries in your inventory can be shift right-clicked to enable ¬ßdcharging¬ßr your EU items.
tfg.quests.lv.batteries.desc2=LV¬ßr, ¬ßbMV¬ßr, and ¬ß6HV¬ßr Batteries come in three forms, allowing you to pick the one you find the best depending on materials you have. ¬ß2Lithium¬ßr has the best capacity, followed by ¬ß7Cadmium¬ßr, then ¬ß9Sodium¬ßr. You will need either an ¬ß3Electrolyzer¬ßr or a ¬ß3Centrifuge¬ßr to obtain them.
tfg.quests.lv.batteries.desc3=My recommendation is: find a Salt vein, and either ¬ßaelectrolyze Salt¬ßr for ¬ßdSodium¬ßr, or ¬ßaOre wash crushed Lepidolite¬ßr for ¬ßdLithium¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.batteries.desc4=Get ¬ßeany¬ßr of the three batteries to complete this quest.

tfg.quests.lv.extractor.title=Basic Extractor
tfg.quests.lv.extractor.subtitle=¬ßoThe Steam Extractor extracts... Wait no this was in the line one chapter ago!¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.extractor.desc1=The reason I did not present LV versions of Steam machines is because they are not required! You may not want to invest into an upgrade that virtually does nothing. Except for ¬ßothis one¬ßr specifically because it does more.
tfg.quests.lv.extractor.desc2=The ¬ß3Basic Extractor¬ßr gains Fluid capabilities, which enables ¬ßaFluid Extraction¬ßr. Use it to melt Rubber that you previously solidified, to ¬ßdmelt Soldering Alloy¬ßr for your circuits, to ¬ßdmelt Red Alloy¬ßr for the ¬ß6best Vacuum Tube recipe¬ßr in the ¬ß3Assembler¬ßr!

tfg.quests.lv.circuitassembling.title=Basic Circuit Assembling Machine
tfg.quests.lv.circuitassembling.subtitle=¬ßoHopefully your first MV Circuit expense.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.circuitassembling.desc=¬ßoHopefully your first MV Circuit expense.¬ßr

tfg.quests.lv.mvcircuits.title=First MV Circuits!
tfg.quests.lv.mvcircuits.subtitle=MV Circuits! Does this mean MV Age...? Well, do you have Aluminium?¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.mvcircuits.desc1=Each Electric Age has Circuits corresponding to its tier. The Good Electronic Circuit is the ¬ßdfirst MV Circuit¬ßr you can make, out of three.
tfg.quests.lv.mvcircuits.desc2=The next thing you should probably do is craft a ¬ß3Circuit Assembling Machine¬ßr to make more Circuits! For cheaper!
tfg.quests.lv.mvcircuits.desc3=Having this and Aluminium will grant access to MV Machines.¬ßr

tfg.quests.lv.diodes.title=Diodes
tfg.quests.lv.diodes.subtitle=Don't let JEI fool you, there's only one available recipe right now for this Primitive Diode.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.diodes.desc1=Diode has a inconvenient recipe, but it will get cheaper and more convenient once you can obtain Polyethylene.
tfg.quests.lv.diodes.desc2=This is required for ¬ßdMV Circuits¬ßr.

tfg.quests.lv.assembling.title=Basic Assembling Machine
tfg.quests.lv.assembling.subtitle=While this is an extremely ¬ß9important¬ßr machine, this will ¬ß9¬ßlnot help you immediately¬ßr as it is expensive. Most of the recipes you want to unlock require ¬ßcfluids¬ßr. Get a little bit more infrastructure before rushing this.
tfg.quests.lv.assembling.desc1=The ¬ß3Assembling Machine¬ßr is core to gameplay. Consider it as important as a Crafting Table, except... well, it's a machine duh.
tfg.quests.lv.assembling.desc2=We as modpack developers also love to use this to include all sorts of custom recipes. And do you know what's the good news? It lets you unlock ¬ßdApplied Energistics¬ßr!
tfg.quests.lv.assembling.desc3=Once you have enough Infrastructure, you will be able to make better recipes for:
tfg.quests.lv.assembling.desc4=¬ß9-¬ßr ¬ß6Vacuum Tubes¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.assembling.desc5=¬ß9-¬ßr ¬ß6Resistors¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.assembling.desc6=¬ß9-¬ßr ¬ß6Circuit Boards¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.assembling.desc7=¬ß9-¬ßr ¬ß6Resistors¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.assembling.desc8=¬ß9-¬ßr ¬ß6Circuit Boards¬ßr

tfg.quests.lv.can.title=16 Shades of Gray
tfg.quests.lv.can.subtitle=Alright, making this is quite involved, this has to be good right?
tfg.quests.lv.can.desc1=Also, this is only an Empty Spray Can, which you have to fill with Chemical Dye.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.can.desc2=So, the Spray Cans do not provide any functionality for machines, but are quite ¬ßbvisually appealing and useful¬ßr!
tfg.quests.lv.can.desc3=Any (or almost) GregTech TileEntity can be ¬ß6painted¬ßr to one of the 16 colors of your chosing. This is great for screenshots, or to separate different setups for visualization in a Multiplayer base. They also help with distinguishing between pipelines and cables.

tfg.quests.lv.board.title=Evil Circuit Board
tfg.quests.lv.board.subtitle=¬ßoI'm not sure why it's called "Good" Circuit Board, as I consider it rather evil to craft.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.board.desc1=This Circuit Board is used to create ¬ßdMV Circuits¬ßr!
tfg.quests.lv.board.desc2=¬ß9Note:¬ßr You have ¬ßltwo¬ßr options to make the Phenolic Circuit Board. Using ¬ßaSodium Persulfate¬ßr or ¬ßaIron III Chloride¬ßr, making boards takes ¬ß6only a quarter of the Silver¬ßr as opposed to the crafting recipe.
tfg.quests.lv.board.desc3=¬ßlHowever¬ßr given how painful it may be for you to obtain these chemicals ¬ßoright now¬ßr, you may want to simply use more Silver by mining most of a Galena Vein...
tfg.quests.lv.board.desc4=The Quest for Sodium Persulfate is in the MV chapter, if you are interested in that.

tfg.quests.lv.glued.title=Glued
tfg.quests.lv.glued.subtitle=¬ßoIt is time to stop processing Resin through the Extractor.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.glued.desc1=You can now ¬ß3centrifuge¬ßr ¬ßaResin¬ßr, which will still give the Raw Rubber, alongside with ¬ßaGlue¬ßr (and the less useful Plantball).
tfg.quests.lv.glued.desc2=Make a lot of Glue. You can use for ¬ß6cheaper Resistors¬ßr, ¬ß6cheaper Circuit Boards¬ßr in the ¬ß3Assembling Machine¬ßr and more... ¬ßoin the next quest¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.glued.desc3=Note:¬ßr Submit a fluid by having it stored in ¬ßlany¬ßr tank in your inventory. A bucket will also work.

tfg.quests.lv.gallium.title=Gallium Arsenide
tfg.quests.lv.gallium.subtitle=Many materials going forward cannot be smelted directly from any Ores! They are instead obtained as byproducts from processing of other ores. Gallium and Arsenic are among these materials.
tfg.quests.lv.gallium.desc1=For ¬ßdGallium¬ßr, you may, ranged from worst to best:
tfg.quests.lv.gallium.desc2=¬ß9- ¬ß3Electrolyze ¬ßaSphalerite¬ßr for a low chance of small dust. Note that you lose on direct smelting value.
tfg.quests.lv.gallium.desc3=¬ß9-¬ßr Put ¬ßaCrushed Bauxite¬ßr in the ¬ß3Chemical Bath¬ßr. Note that this requires ¬ß9Sodium Persulfate¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.gallium.desc4=¬ß9-¬ßr Obtain it as a Byproduct of ¬ßaSphalerite¬ßr Ore Processing, in the ¬ß3Thermal Centrifuge¬ßr or ¬ß3Centrifuge¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.gallium.desc5=For ¬ßdArsenic¬ßr, you will have to mine and ¬ßacentrifuge Realgar¬ßr.

tfg.quests.lv.centrifuge.title=Basic Centrifuge
tfg.quests.lv.centrifuge.desc1=Outside of Ore Processing:¬ßr Oh boy this machine does a lot... Decomposition recipes to separate dust types, separating air and many others... The list is too long, let's just say ¬ßcyou need the Centrifuge¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.centrifuge.desc2=For Ore Processing:¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.centrifuge.desc3=This takes ¬ßaImpure Dust¬ßr or ¬ßaPurified Dust¬ßr and turns them into clean Dust plus an added tiny Dust ¬ß6Byproduct¬ßr. This is outside of the optimal chain for Byproducts, but this is also the cheapest Ore Processing machine of this set to run and to setup on a small scale.

tfg.quests.lv.mixer.title=Basic Mixer
tfg.quests.lv.mixer.subtitle=¬ßoThis Mixer mixes... What did you expect at this point?¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.mixer.desc1=Put this machine off until you actually require it for recipes in progression.
tfg.quests.lv.mixer.desc2=Some hand alloys can also be made in the mixer, except at higher yield.

tfg.quests.lv.oxygen.title=Breath of Fresh Oxygen
tfg.quests.lv.oxygen.subtitle=¬ßoIf you wanted to be picky, it would be Dioxygen, or Oxygen Gas. But gameplay convention makes it simply Oxygen.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.oxygen.desc1=You could be spending ¬ßominutes¬ßr in JEI looking for Oxygen recipes given the many ways to obtain it. Various minerals will produce it when electrolyzed
tfg.quests.lv.oxygen.desc2=However the best source according to me (!) is ¬ßacentrifuging Air¬ßr after making a ¬ßdGas Collector¬ßr, which you probably cannot make just yet. This recipe also gives ¬ßaNitrogen¬ßr, which can speed up certain ¬ß9Electric Blast Furnace¬ßr recipes¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.oxygen.desc3=The second best source according to me (!) is ¬ßaelectrolyzing Silicon Dioxide¬ßr. Silicon Dioxide is obtained from various sources, such as Glass Dust, Granite Dust and Black Granite Dust.
tfg.quests.lv.oxygen.desc4=The third best source according to me (!) is ¬ßaelectrolyzing Water¬ßr. But that's more for ¬ßaHydrogen¬ßr due to the higher energy cost.
tfg.quests.lv.oxygen.desc5=The fourth best source according to me (!) is ¬ßato not void¬ßr it, ever. Any Oxygen obtained from any source is worth something and should be stored in Tanks. The ¬ß3Steel Multiblock Tank¬ßr is a good candidate for storing Oxygen... Or you can simply make more drums.
tfg.quests.lv.oxygen.desc6=¬ßeNote:¬ßr Submit a fluid by having it stored in ¬ßlany¬ßr tank in your inventory. A bucket will also work.

tfg.quests.lv.arc.title=Basic Arc Furnace
tfg.quests.lv.arc.subtitle=The description of the machine refers to metallurgy where Blast Furnace and Arc Furnace serve a similar purpose, not exactly here though!¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.arc.desc1=The ¬ß3Arc Furnace¬ßr uses a little bit of ¬ß9Oxygen¬ßr to smelt items in a different fashion than Furnaces.
tfg.quests.lv.arc.desc2=You can use it to make easier ¬ßaWrought Iron¬ßr, ¬ßaGlass¬ßr, and gain access to ¬ßaAnnealed Copper¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.arc.desc3=It can also recycle various components and machines back to their original material.

tfg.quests.lv.electrolyzer.title=Basic Electrolyzer
tfg.quests.lv.electrolyzer.desc1=Outside of Ore Processing:¬ßr  This machine, similarly to the Centrifuge, also does a lot of things...   And I cannot list them! But fortunately it's one of the cheapest, so get it whenever you want something from it.
tfg.quests.lv.electrolyzer.desc2=For Ore Processing:¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.electrolyzer.desc3=So, I lied, it's not ¬ßoexactly¬ßr in the Ore Processing, it's actually for ¬ßaDecomposition of Dusts¬ßr. However, most of this style of Decomposition through Electrolysis is locked at ¬ßbMV¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.electrolyzer.desc4=You can see the ¬ßemolecular formula¬ßr in Dust tooltips to see at a glance what you can get from them.
tfg.quests.lv.electrolyzer.desc5=Take caution!¬ßr Due to how ores work, Dusts which can be ¬ßddirectly smelted¬ßr into Ingots can give higher metal yields than electrolysis. However, it means you lose the other products in the dust. You will have to decide for yourself on each case.

tfg.quests.lv.sapphire.title=Sapphire
tfg.quests.lv.sapphire.subtitle=With LV power, the only way of getting ¬ßaAluminium Dust¬ßr is by electrolyzing ¬ß9Sapphire¬ßr or ¬ß2Green Sapphire¬ßr. Aluminium is the main ¬ßbMV¬ßr material.
tfg.quests.lv.sapphire.desc=I could advise to get enough Sapphire to electrolyze into one full stack of ¬ßaAluminium Dust¬ßr, that ¬ßlwill¬ßr be helpful. Plus the bonus Oxygen is always nice.

tfg.quests.lv.cutting.title=Basic Cutting Machine
tfg.quests.lv.cutting.subtitle=¬ßoThe Cutting Machine... cuts... thanks to lubrification.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.cutting.desc1=For now, you may use ¬ß9Water¬ßr over trying to acquire Lubricant.
tfg.quests.lv.cutting.desc2=The ¬ß3Cutting Machine¬ßr enables converting ¬ß6Rods into four Bolts¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.cutting.desc3=This machine is the only way to obtain ¬ßdGem Plates¬ßr, which are needed to craft Filters, and by extension the ¬ß9Air Collector¬ßr.

tfg.quests.lv.gascollector.title=Basic Gas Collector
tfg.quests.lv.gascollector.subtitle=The Gas Collector collects Air, to centrifuge into ¬ßaOxygen¬ßr and ¬ßaNitrogen¬ßr.

tfg.quests.lv.what.title=What is this Mess? Part Two
tfg.quests.lv.what.subtitle=¬ßoHey you! Yes you! HEY!! Why are you running away!?¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.what.desc1=This quest is a presentation of the ¬ßdFull Scale of regular Ore Processing¬ßr. Why "regular" you may ask? Well... some ores are special but that's for much later. Oh no I'm getting carried away!
tfg.quests.lv.what.desc2=If you haven't noticed the ¬ßaOre Byproduct¬ßr Tab in ¬ßaJEI¬ßr, press U on any GT ore, and it should be the second rightmost Tab.
tfg.quests.lv.what.desc3=This tab presents all the Ore Processing recipes! As you can see, Ores can give many ¬ß6Byproducts¬ßr, some of which do not exist as an Ore.
tfg.quests.lv.what.desc4=Whenever you want to obtain a material, refer to that page to see if you can obtain it, and select the process that you will find to be the most suitable.
tfg.quests.lv.what.desc5=Each Quest surrounding this one presents a different machine that has some relation to Ore Processing.
tfg.quests.lv.what.desc6=¬ßcNote:¬ßr Do not get too carried over with Ore Processing yet! It is slow and somewhat power hungry. Around 90% of ores are not important enough to warrant going out of your way to obtain the Byproducts.

tfg.quests.lv.packager.title=Basic Packager
tfg.quests.lv.packager.subtitle=The ¬ß3Packager¬ßr compresses ¬ßaTiny Dusts¬ßr and ¬ßaSmall Dusts¬ßr into ¬ßafull Dusts¬ßr, and Nuggets into Ingots. It can also work in reverse, change between sizes of Wires, and more...
tfg.quests.lv.packager.desc1=Unpacking Cables back into Wires and Rubber will be appreciated once you rework your Energy Network.
tfg.quests.lv.packager.desc2=We will present a guide later on how to set it up in the middle of ¬ßdOre Processing¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.packager.desc3=The short explanation is: you can use a¬ß9 Robot Arm¬ßr set to ¬ßdSupply Exact¬ßr ¬ß59¬ßr to prevent non-whole amounts of Tiny Dusts clogging the Packager.

tfg.quests.lv.washing.title=Basic Ore Washing Plant
tfg.quests.lv.washing.subtitle=This machine combines Cauldron washing for simple automation, but also advanced and precise washing for byproducts.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.washing.desc1=Washing a ¬ßaCrushed Ore¬ßr will grant a ¬ßaPurified Ore¬ßr which can refined further, some useless stone, and more importantly the first ¬ß6Byproduct¬ßr.
tfg.quests.lv.washing.desc2=Any Ore will give at ¬ß9minimum 2/3rd of a Dust¬ßr of this Byproduct through washing! So prioritize this step the most.
tfg.quests.lv.washing.desc3=Distilled Water over Water cuts recipe duration in half, but is also less convenient to produce.

tfg.quests.lv.bath.title=Basic Chemical Bath
tfg.quests.lv.bath.subtitle=Basic Chemical Bath
tfg.quests.lv.bath.desc1=Outside of Ore Processing:¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.bath.desc2=You can make ¬ß6Paper out of Wood¬ßr, to throw away your ¬ßaSugar Canes¬ßr¬ß9*¬ßr. I know you hate them.
tfg.quests.lv.bath.desc3=There are some other less important recipes, such as applying colours to various items and blocks, or bleaching them.
tfg.quests.lv.bath.desc4=¬ß9*¬ßr ¬ßaSugar¬ßr will still be appreciated as a part of ¬ßcTNT¬ßr production in the ¬ß6HV¬ßr age, unfortunately.
tfg.quests.lv.bath.desc5=¬ßlFor Ore Processing:¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.bath.desc6=Some ¬ßaCrushed Ores¬ßr have an alternate recipe on the way to ¬ßaPurified Ore¬ßr, involving bathing in either ¬ßaMercury¬ßr or ¬ßaSodium Persulfate¬ßr. This step is not really important, unless you really want that special ¬ß6Byproduct¬ßr. This can be a nice alternate source of Gold.

tfg.quests.lv.sifting.title=Basic Sifting Machine
tfg.quests.lv.sifting.subtitle=The Sifter sifts ¬ßdGem type¬ßr ¬ßaPurified Ores¬ßr to find ¬ßaExquisite¬ßr and ¬ßaFlawless¬ßr Gems, which can be cut into normal Gems. It also finds ¬ßaPurified Dusts¬ßr of that gem. Overall this gives a ¬ß6higher yield¬ßr than other means.
tfg.quests.lv.sifting.desc1=A small amount of ¬ßdFlawless Emerald¬ßr will be required in the MV Age, and running the ores in ¬ß3Sifting Machine¬ßr is how you obtain them.
tfg.quests.lv.sifting.desc2=Each higher tier of ¬ß3Sifter¬ßr increases the chance of all Gem types to be found, at the cost of more energy. More on Overclocking.
tfg.quests.lv.sifting.desc3=¬ß9Note:¬ßr If you crushed Gem Ores (such as Diamond), it is critical you use this machine to recover the actual gems in non dust form. However this is a rather slow process, so you may sometimes want to smelt this type of ore directly into the Gem.

tfg.quests.lv.thermal.title=Basic Thermal Centrifuge
tfg.quests.lv.thermal.subtitle=The ¬ß3Thermal Centrifuge¬ßr is the most energy hungry out of the Ore Processing machines.
tfg.quests.lv.thermal.desc=It takes ¬ßaCrushed Ore¬ßr or ¬ßaPurified Ore¬ßr to give a different ¬ß6Byproduct¬ßr from the ¬ß3Ore Washer¬ßr, but at the same rate.

tfg.quests.lv.autoclave.title=autoclave
tfg.quests.lv.autoclave.subtitle=The Autoclave typically is the last step of Ore Processing, to turn a few select ¬ßaGem Dusts¬ßr back regular Gems.
tfg.quests.lv.autoclave.desc1=It is very slow so in general it is not advised to crush gem ores at all, as the recovery process is too expensive.
tfg.quests.lv.autoclave.desc2=¬ß9Note:¬ßr In this modpack, the Autoclave is required to make Fluix Crystals to progress in Applied Energistics.

tfg.quests.lv.separator.title=Basic Electromagnetic Separator
tfg.quests.lv.separator.subtitle=A rarely used machine. It uses magnetic fields to separate some Magnetic ores and gain additional ¬ß6Byproducts¬ßr you would not obtain otherwise.

tfg.quests.lv.macerator.title=Universal Macerator
tfg.quests.lv.macerator.subtitle=¬ß5Player:¬ßr ¬ßoThat's it, I give up, you are going insane! We are in LV Age but you present me a HV machine!?¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.macerator.desc1=¬ß5Writer:¬ßr ¬ßoHold on... There must have been a reason. Ah! Let me grab my script.¬ßr
tfg.quests.lv.macerator.desc2=Yes! This is indeed not completable yet, which is also why this quest appears in the HV Chapter.
tfg.quests.lv.macerator.desc3=Remember the thing about Macerator I told you that made you feel unxtremely sad and disappointed? Well... that disappointment is gonna keep going until then.
tfg.quests.lv.macerator.desc4=¬ß6The Macerator will unlock its second and third slot at HV¬ßr. And this will be great for Ore Processing. In fact if you check the Ore Processing JEI page, you will see that one byproduct is absolutely locked by this, after the Thermal Centrifuge step.
tfg.quests.lv.macerator.desc5=Note:¬ßr Unlike in GTCE, the ¬ßbMV¬ßr Macerator in GTCEu does ¬ßcnot¬ßr have a second slot!
tfg.quests.lv.macerator.desc6=¬ß5Writer:¬ßr ¬ßoCome back to me when you are stronger, young Padawan.¬ßr
